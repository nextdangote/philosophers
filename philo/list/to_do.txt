activities the philosophers will perform and will have to be printed :
- take a fork (maybe even specify right or left)
- eat : has to take two forks before, has to drop the forks after then sleep
- sleep : nothing happens just assign the time that was given by user input, then think
- think : i guess that is just a waiting period and then eat
- die : if time_to_die is <= then the time between last eating period and now -> die

- in this case what is a fork ??

what is a thread ?
what is a mutex ?


- give a number to each philosopher/thread
- 

personal notes :

number of forks is = to number of philosophers.
